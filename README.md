# kickstarter_analysis_excel
##**Overview**## of Project	“Louise” an up-and-coming playwright is looking to start her first play. She decided to use crowdfunding as a resource to raise money for it. She needed insight on what successful crowdfunding campaigns look like from start to finish, to model hers from.



###**Purpose**### of this project is to analyze campaigns to find what models are most successful. Data included campaign goals, number of backer/donors, and money raised. Success was measured by whether the campaigns reached/exceeded their fundraising goal. This analysis was achieved by creating Pivot tables and corresponding line charts to allow the visualization of the effects, if any, that launch dates and the overall goal have on a campaign.
